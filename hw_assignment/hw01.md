### Main task

**Context**

- Assume that you have to introduce the datasets to your boss (smart, but busy) in a company or lab, who has no idea about the datasets. What would you do to effectively introduce and summarize the data? 

**Aim**

- The aim of this homework is 1) to try many JAMOVI components within the "Data Exploration" part and 2) to learn more about the data. These will be the basis for the evaluation. 

**Basic task**

- Run the descriptive statistics on the **Study 1 and 2 datasets** (demographics.csv only). Please analyze both datasets using mean, median, standard deviation, frequency, plots, etc.
